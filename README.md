# Ubuntu Touch Security VAPT Report

Welcome to the Ubuntu Touch penetration test repository. This project provides a detailed breakdown of security findings from an assessment of Ubuntu Touch (v16.04, Kernel 5.4.0).

The goal is to offer a clear, actionable resource for developers and the open-source community to improve the security posture of the operating system.

## Security Findings Summary

### Critical Severity
- **CVE-2021-3493**: Linux Kernel OverlayFS Privilege Escalation
- **Insecure Credential Storage**: Plaintext storage of sensitive authentication data

### High Severity
- **Disabled ASLR**: Address Space Layout Randomization not properly implemented
- **Weak Snap Confinement**: Insufficient security policies for snap packages

### Medium Severity
- **Outdated Snap Packages**: Multiple packages with known security vulnerabilities
- **Unencrypted Device Storage**: Lack of encryption for user data and system files
- **Unrestricted Sudo Access**: Overly permissive privilege management

## Tools and Scripts

### Proof of Concept
- `CVE-2021-3493-poc.c`: Demonstrates the OverlayFS privilege escalation vulnerability

### Automation
- `mobsf_setup.sh`: Automated setup of Mobile Security Framework for Ubuntu Touch testing

## Usage

### Running the CVE-2021-3493 PoC
```bash
cd scripts
gcc -o cve-2021-3493-poc CVE-2021-3493-poc.c
./cve-2021-3493-poc
```

### Setting up MobSF for Testing
```bash
cd scripts
chmod +x mobsf_setup.sh
./mobsf_setup.sh
```
