# Disabled Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)

## Finding Information
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **CVE**: N/A
- **Component**: Ubuntu Touch Memory Protection
- **Discovery Date**: 2024-01-15

## Description
Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) is disabled or not properly implemented on Ubuntu Touch devices, making them vulnerable to memory-based attacks such as buffer overflows and return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks.

## Technical Details
ASLR is a security technique that randomizes the memory addresses where system executables and libraries are loaded. When disabled, attackers can predict memory layouts and craft more reliable exploits.

**Root Cause**: ASLR configuration is disabled in kernel parameters or not supported by the current kernel version.

**Affected Systems**: Ubuntu Touch devices with disabled ASLR.

## Proof of Concept
```bash
# Check ASLR status
cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

# Expected output should be 2 (full ASLR enabled)
# If output is 0 or 1, ASLR is disabled or partially enabled

# Test memory layout predictability
for i in {1..10}; do
    cat /proc/self/maps | head -1
done
```

## Impact Assessment
- **Confidentiality**: High - Easier exploitation of memory vulnerabilities
- **Integrity**: High - Increased success rate of code injection attacks
- **Availability**: Medium - Potential for system crashes
- **Business Impact**: Increased risk of successful exploitation, potential system compromise

## Remediation
### Immediate Actions
- [ ] Enable ASLR by setting randomize_va_space to 2
- [ ] Verify ASLR is working correctly
- [ ] Test applications for ASLR compatibility

### Long-term Fixes
- [ ] Update kernel to support full ASLR
- [ ] Implement additional memory protection mechanisms
- [ ] Regular security testing of memory protections
- [ ] Application hardening for ASLR compatibility
