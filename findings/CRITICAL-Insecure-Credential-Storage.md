# Insecure Credential Storage

## Finding Information
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **CVE**: N/A
- **Component**: Ubuntu Touch Credential Management
- **Discovery Date**: 2024-01-15

## Description
Ubuntu Touch stores user credentials and authentication tokens in plaintext or weakly encrypted formats, making them vulnerable to extraction by malicious applications or attackers with physical access to the device.

## Technical Details
The vulnerability exists in the credential storage mechanism where:
- WiFi passwords are stored in plaintext in configuration files
- Application authentication tokens lack proper encryption
- Biometric data templates are stored without adequate protection
- Keychain data is accessible to other applications

**Root Cause**: Insufficient encryption and access controls for sensitive credential data.

**Affected Systems**: All Ubuntu Touch devices with stored credentials.

## Proof of Concept
```bash
# Access WiFi credentials
cat /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/*

# Access application data
ls -la /home/phablet/.local/share/

# Check keychain accessibility
find /home/phablet/.local/share/ -name "*key*" -o -name "*credential*"
```

## Impact Assessment
- **Confidentiality**: High - Complete access to user credentials
- **Integrity**: High - Ability to modify authentication data
- **Availability**: Medium - Potential for account lockouts
- **Business Impact**: Complete compromise of user accounts, potential data breach, privacy violations

## Remediation
### Immediate Actions
- [ ] Implement proper credential encryption
- [ ] Audit all credential storage locations
- [ ] Remove plaintext credential storage
- [ ] Implement secure keychain with proper access controls

### Long-term Fixes
- [ ] Use hardware security modules for credential storage
- [ ] Implement proper key derivation functions
- [ ] Regular security audits of credential management
- [ ] User education on credential security
