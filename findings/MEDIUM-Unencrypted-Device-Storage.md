# Unencrypted Device Storage

## Finding Information
- **Severity**: MEDIUM
- **CVE**: N/A
- **Component**: Ubuntu Touch Storage Security
- **Discovery Date**: 2024-01-15

## Description
Ubuntu Touch devices store user data and application information in unencrypted format, making sensitive information vulnerable to extraction if the device is lost, stolen, or accessed by unauthorized parties.

## Technical Details
The device storage lacks proper encryption for:
- User data and documents
- Application databases and caches
- System logs and configuration files
- Temporary files and swap space
- SD card and external storage

**Root Cause**: Missing or disabled storage encryption mechanisms.

**Affected Systems**: Ubuntu Touch devices without storage encryption enabled.

## Proof of Concept
```bash
# Check encryption status
lsblk -f

# Check for encrypted partitions
sudo cryptsetup status /dev/sdaX

# Verify file system encryption
mount | grep -i crypt

# Check swap encryption
swapon -s
```

## Impact Assessment
- **Confidentiality**: High - Complete access to stored data
- **Integrity**: Medium - Potential for data modification
- **Availability**: Low - Minimal impact on system availability
- **Business Impact**: Data breach risk, privacy violations, compliance issues

## Remediation
### Immediate Actions
- [ ] Enable full disk encryption
- [ ] Encrypt swap space
- [ ] Implement file-level encryption for sensitive data
- [ ] Secure external storage access

### Long-term Fixes
- [ ] Implement hardware-based encryption
- [ ] Regular security audits of storage encryption
- [ ] User education on data protection
- [ ] Implement data loss prevention measures
